# C++ Code README

## Description
This repository contains two C++ programs, each serving a different purpose as outlined below:

### Task 1: Update 7,1,7
This program reads integers from a file named `input.txt`, dynamically increases the size of an array to accommodate the read integers, removes occurrences of the pattern `7,1,7` from the array, and finally displays the modified array.

### Task 2: Find 3 Letter Pattern
This program reads a line of text from a file named `line_text.txt`, shrinks the array to fit the text, finds occurrences of a user-inputted three-letter pattern, removes occurrences of the pattern, and displays the modified text.

## Instructions
1. **Compile**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the source files. For example:
   ```
   g++ task1.cpp -o task1
   g++ task2.cpp -o task2
   ```
2. **Run**: Execute the compiled binaries.
   ```
   ./task1
   ./task2
   ```

## Files
- `task1.cpp`: Contains the implementation of Task 1.
- `task2.cpp`: Contains the implementation of Task 2.
- `input.txt`: Contains input integers for Task 1.
- `line_text.txt`: Contains a line of text for Task 2.
